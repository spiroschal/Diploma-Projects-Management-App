# Diploma-Projects-Management-App
This project aims to develop a user-friendly web application facilitating the management of diploma thesis projects for both students and professors. This project follows a Scrum approach. Key points include the project implementation, a detailed Sprint report, and documentation covering use cases and application design. Scoring is based on working implementations, tests, design quality, and reporting. Functional requirements encompass account creation, thesis subject access, application submission, and grading. Non-functional requirements prioritize maintainability and usability. The application, built in Java with Spring framework and MySQL, focuses on simplicity and ease of use.
